/**
 * Direction-aware scroll reveals for the landing page.
 *
 * Every reveal replays each time its element enters the viewport. The key is
 * where an element "parks" while hidden: one that scrolled out through the
 * top (user scrolling down) parks slightly above its spot, so scrolling back
 * up brings it in moving down; one that left through the bottom parks below
 * and comes back moving up — mirroring the first-time reveal.
 *
 * Only an element with its own `initial="hidden"` gets this: when it leaves
 * view, framer-motion re-resolves its initial variant (calling the functions
 * below) and uses that variant's transition. Variant children without their
 * own `initial` keep the pose cached at mount, so put the movement on the
 * container and let children only fade.
